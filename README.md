# PowerShell-AD-SQL


- Displayed a table using GridView for teams to view and update information about servers they owned
- Information included server name, java version, .net version, location, ram, cpu cores, cpu name, number of processors, date updated
- Some were editable and others were not (information gathered from the PowerShell script)
- Helped with the migration of servers and decommission old servers
- PowerShell script ran every night and checked real data against the database and AD then updated the database where necessary
